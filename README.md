# Android-Nanodegree-Project-2-Movies-App-Stage-1-Stage2

In this project, you will build an app to help users discover popular and recent movies. You will build a clean UI, sync to a server, and present information to the user.
You will add to the app you built in Stage 1 by building on the detail view for each movie, allowing users to 'favorite' movies, and adding a tablet layout.
