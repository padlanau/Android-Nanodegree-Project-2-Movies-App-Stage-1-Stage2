# Android-Nanodegree-Project-2-Movies-App-Stage-1-Stage2

In this project, you will build an app to help users discover popular and recent movies. You will build a clean UI, sync to a server, and present information to the user.
You will add to the app you built in Stage 1 by building on the detail view for each movie, allowing users to 'favorite' movies, and adding a tablet layout.

Project Overview
You’ll add more information to your movie details view:

You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
Lastly, you’ll optimize your app experience for tablet.

APIs used:
- Content Providers
- Hooking it up with Loaders
